                    <p>Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout method for arranging items in rows or columns. Items flex (expand) to fill additional space or shrink to fit into smaller spaces. This article explains all the fundamentals.</p>

                    </header>
                    <p>For a long time, the only reliable cross-browser compatible tools available for creating CSS layouts were features like floats and positioning. These work, but in some ways they're also limiting and frustrating.</p>
                    <p>The following simple layout designs are either difficult or impossible to achieve with such tools in any kind of convenient, flexible way:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Vertically centering a block of content inside its parent.</li>
                        <li>Making all the children of a container take up an equal amount of the available width/height, regardless of how much width/height is available.</li>
                        <li>Making all columns in a multiple-column layout adopt the same height even if they contain a different amount of content.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>As you'll see in subsequent sections, flexbox makes a lot of layout tasks much easier. Let's dig in!</p>

                    <p>When elements are laid out as flex items, they are laid out along two axes:</p>
                    <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox/flex_terms.png" alt="Three flex items in a left-to-right language are laid out side-by-side in a flex container.

                    <p>Flexbox provides a property called <code>flex-direction</code> that specifies which direction the main axis runs (which direction the flexbox children are laid out in). By default this is set to <code>row</code>, which causes them to be laid out in a row in the direction your browser's default language works in (left to right, in the case of an English browser).</p>

                    </header>
                    <p>One issue that arises when you have a fixed width or height in your layout is that eventually your flexbox children will overflow their container, breaking the layout. Have a look at our <a href="https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/css/css-layout/flexbox/flexbox-wrap0.html">flexbox-wrap0.html</a> example and try <a href="https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/css/css-layout/flexbox/flexbox-wrap0.html">viewing it live</a> (take a local copy of this file now if you want to follow along with this example):</p>
                    <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox/flexbox-example3.png" alt="The Sample flexbox example has all the flex items laid out in a single row of the flex container. The eighth flex item overflows the browser window, and the page has visible horizontal and vertical scroll bars as it cannot be accommodated within the width of the window as the previous seven flex items have taken the space available within the viewport. By default, the Browser tries to place all the flex items in a single row if the flex-direction is set to row or a single column if the flex-direction is set to column." width="1003" height="795" loading="lazy">
                    <p>Here we see that the children are indeed breaking out of their container. One way in which you can fix this is to add the following declaration to your <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> rule:</p>
                    <div class="code-snippet">
                        <div class="doc-type">CSS</div>

                                <code>
<span class="css-property">flex-wrap</span>: wrap;
                                </code>
                            </pre>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>Also, add the following declaration to your <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> rule:</p>
                    <div class="code-snippet">
                        <div class="doc-type">CSS</div>

                            <pre>
                                <code>
<span class="css-property">flex</span>: 200px;
                                </code>
                            </pre>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>Try this now. You'll see that the layout looks much better with this included:</p>
                    <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox/flexbox-example4.png" alt="Flex items are laid out in multiple rows in the flex container. The flex-wrap property is set to 'wrap' in the flex container which displays the flex items in a new row if the flex items in the previous row overflow outside the flexbox container. Each flex item is given a width of 200 pixels. All the items are stretched to be the same height, as tall as the flex item with the most content." width="1005" height="793" loading="lazy">
                    <p>We now have multiple rows. Each row has as many flexbox children fitted into it as is sensible. Any overflow is moved down to the next line. The <code>flex: 200px</code> declaration set on the articles means that each will be at least 200px wide. We'll discuss this property in more detail later on. You might also notice that the last few children on the last row are each made wider so that the entire row is still filled.</p>
                    <p>But there's more we can do here. First of all, try changing your <code>flex-direction</code> property value to row-reverse. Now you'll see that you still have your multiple row layout, but it starts from the opposite corner of the browser window and flows in reverse.</p>

                    </header>
                    <p>Let's now return to our first example and look at how we can control what proportion of space flex items take up compared to the other flex items. Fire up your local copy of <a href="https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/css/css-layout/flexbox/flexbox0.html">flexbox0.html</a>, or take a copy of <a href="https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/css/css-layout/flexbox/flexbox1.html">flexbox1.html</a> as a new starting point (<a href="https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/css/css-layout/flexbox/flexbox1.html">see it live</a>).</p>
                    <p>First, add the following rule to the bottom of your CSS:</p>
                    <div class="code-snippet">
                        <div class="doc-type">CSS</div>
                        <div class="code-block">
                            <pre>
                                <code>
<span class="css-selector">article</span> {
    <span class="css-property">flex</span>: 1;
}
                                </code>
                            </pre>
                        </div>
                    </div><!--/.code-snippet -->

                    <p>Now add the following rule below the previous one:</p>
                    <div class="code-snippet">
                        <div class="doc-type">CSS</div>
                        <div class="code-block">
                            <pre>
                                <code>
<span class="css-selector">article:nth-of-type(3)</span> {
    <span class="css-property">flex</span>: 2;
}
                                </code>
                            </pre>
                        </div>
                    </div><!--/.code-snippet -->

                    <p>Now when you refresh, you'll see that the third <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> takes up twice as much of the available width as the other two. There are now four proportion units available in total (since 1 + 1 + 2 = 4). The first two flex items have one unit each, so they each take 1/4 of the available space. The third one has two units, so it takes up 2/4 of the available space (or one-half).</p>
                    <p>You can also specify a minimum size value within the flex value. Try updating your existing article rules like so:</p>
                    <div class="code-snippet">
                        <div class="doc-type">CSS</div>
                        <div class="code-block">
                            <pre>
                                <code>
<span class="css-selector">article</span> {
    <span class="css-property">flex</span>: 1 200px;
}

<span class="css-selector">article:nth-of-type(3)</span> {
    <span class="css-property">flex</span>: 2 200px;
}
                                </code>
                            </pre>
                        </div>
                    </div><!--/.code-snippet -->

                    <p>This basically states, "Each flex item will first be given 200px of the available space. After that, the rest of the available space will be shared according to the proportion units." Try refreshing and you'll see a difference in how the space is shared.</p>

All the flex items have a minimum width of 200 pixels—set using 'flex'. The value of flex for first two flex items is 1 and for the third item is 2. This splits the remaining space in the flex container into 4 proportion units. One unit is assigned to each of the first two flex items and 2 units are assigned to the third flex item, making the third flex item wider than the other two, which are of the same width." width="800" height="324" loading="lazy">

                    <p>The real value of flexbox can be seen in its flexibility/responsiveness. If you resize the browser window or add another <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> element, the layout continues to work just fine.</p>

                        <h2>flex shorthand vs longhand</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p><code>flex</code> is a shorthand property that can specify up to three different values:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The unitless proportion value we discussed above. This can be specified separately using the <code>flex-grow</code> longhand property.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            A second unitless proportion value, <code>flex-shrink</code>, which comes into play when the flex items are overflowing their container. This value specifies how much an item will shrink in order to prevent overflow. This is quite an advanced flexbox feature and we won't be covering it any further in this article.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The minimum size value we discussed above. This can be specified separately using the <code>flex-basis</code> longhand value.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    </header>
                    <p>You can also use flexbox features to align flex items along the main or cross axis. Let's explore this by looking at a new example: <a href="https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/css/css-layout/flexbox/flex-align0.html">flex-align0.html</a> (<a href="https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/css/css-layout/flexbox/flex-align0.html">see it live also</a>). We're going to turn this into a neat, flexible button/toolbar. At the moment you'll see a horizontal menu bar with some buttons jammed into the top left-hand corner.</p>

                    <p>First, take a local copy of this example.</p>
                    <p>Now, add the following to the bottom of the example's CSS:</p>
                    
                    <div class="code-snippet">
                        <div class="doc-type">CSS</div>
                        <div class="code-block">
                            <pre>
                                <code>
<span class="css-selector">div</span> {
    <span class="css-property">display</span>: flex;
    <span class="css-property">align-items</span>: center;
    <span class="css-property">justify-content</span>: space-around;
}
                                </code>
                            </pre>
                        </div>
                    </div><!--/.code-snippet -->
                    <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox/flexbox_center_space-around.png" alt="Five buttons with labels Smile, Laugh, Wink, Shrug & Blush are laid out in a row in a flex container. The flex items are positioned at the center of the cross-axis by setting the align-items property to center. The flex items are spaced evenly along the main-axis by setting the justify-content property to space-around." width="1217" height="209" loading="lazy">
                    <p>Refresh the page and you'll see that the buttons are now nicely centered horizontally and vertically. We've done this via two new properties.</p>
                    <p><code>align-items</code> controls where the flex items sit on the cross axis.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            By default, the value is <code>stretch</code>, which stretches all flex items to fill the parent in the direction of the cross axis. If the parent doesn't have a fixed height in the cross axis direction, then all flex items will become as tall as the tallest flex item. This is how our first example had columns of equal height by default.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The <code>center</code> value that we used in our above code causes the items to maintain their intrinsic dimensions, but be centered along the cross axis. This is why our current example's buttons are centered vertically.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You can also have values like <code>flex-start</code> and <code>flex-end</code>, which will align all items at the start and end of the cross axis respectively. See <code>align-items</code> for the full details.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>You can override the <code>align-items</code> behavior for individual flex items by applying the <code>align-self</code> property to them. For example, try adding the following to your CSS:</p>
                    <div class="code-snippet">
                        <div class="doc-type">CSS</div>
                        <div class="code-block">
                            <pre>
                                <code>
<span class="css-selector">button:first-child</span> {
    <span class="css-property">align-self</span>: flex-end;
}
                                </code>
                            </pre>
                        </div>

                <!-- Ordering flex items -->
                <section class="main-section" id="Ordering_flex_items">

                        <h2>Ordering flex items</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p>Flexbox also has a feature for changing the layout order of flex items without affecting the source order. This is another thing that is impossible to do with traditional layout methods.</p>
                    <p>The code for this is simple. Try adding the following CSS to your button bar example code:</p>
                    <div class="code-snippet">
                        <div class="doc-type">CSS</div>
                        <div class="code-block">
                            <pre>
                                <code>
<span class="css-selector">button:first-child</span> {
    <span class="css-property">order</span>: 1;
}
                                </code>
                            </pre>
                        </div>
                    </div><!--/.code-snippet -->
                    <p>Refresh and you'll see that the "Smile" button has moved to the end of the main axis. Let's talk about how this works in a bit more detail:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            By default, all flex items have an <code>order</code> value of 0.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Flex items with higher specified order values will appear later in the display order than items with lower order values.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Flex items with the same order value will appear in their source order. So if you have four items whose order values have been set as 2, 1, 1, and 0 respectively, their display order would be 4th, 2nd, 3rd, then 1st.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The 3rd item appears after the 2nd because it has the same order value and is after it in the source order.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>You can set negative order values to make items appear earlier than items whose value is 0. For example, you could make the "Blush" button appear at the start of the main axis using the following rule:</p>

                    <div class="code-snippet">
                        <div class="doc-type">CSS</div>
                        <div class="code-block">
                            <pre>
                                <code>
<span class="css-selector">button:last-child</span> {
    <span class="css-property">order</span>: -1;
}
                                </code>
                            </pre>
                        </div>
